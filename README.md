This project is based on the *Getting Started in Domino* Tutorial for Python,
found in Domino's [docs](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/get_started/index.html)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/dominodatalab/Domino-Intro-Project-Python).
It has been modified for use in the Intro to Domino for Practitioners training
at the Rev 3 conference (May 4, 2022), and provided here for attendee reference.

See the `slides` folder for full training slides as well as an "activities-only" set of slides.
